Description
Talk Format : Talk(30 Minutes)

In this presentation, I will dive into the exciting realm of Python custom visuals in Power BI, showcasing how Python can enhance the data visualization capabilities of Power BI. I will demonstrate how to leverage Python libraries, such as Matplotlib, Plotly, and Seaborn, to create stunning, interactive, and dynamic visuals that go beyond the out-of-the-box options in Power BI. Attendees will gain hands-on experience in developing custom visuals, integrating them seamlessly with Power BI, and unlocking new insights from their data.

We will focus on the following key areas.

1. Creating Interactive and Dynamic Visuals:

Leveraging Python libraries, such as Matplotlib, Plotly, and Seaborn, to create captivating visuals.
Enhancing interactivity with tooltips, drill-through, and filtering.
Incorporating animations and dynamic updates to engage viewers.

2. Advanced Techniques in Python Custom Visuals:

Customizing visuals with themes, color palettes, and annotations.
Incorporating interactive elements like sliders, dropdowns, and buttons.
Integrating external data sources and APIs to enhance visualizations.

3. Best Practices for Python Custom Visuals:

Optimizing performance and responsiveness of custom visuals.
Implementing accessibility features for inclusive visualization experiences.
Testing, debugging, and troubleshooting Python custom visuals.
