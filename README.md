# Python Custom Visuals in Power BI: Unleashing the Power of Data Visualization 

Talk Format : **Talk(30 Minutes)**

In this presentation, I will dive into the exciting realm of Python custom visuals in Power BI, showcasing how Python can enhance the data visualization capabilities of Power BI. I will demonstrate how to leverage Python libraries, such as Matplotlib, Plotly, and Seaborn, to create stunning, interactive, and dynamic visuals that go beyond the out-of-the-box options in Power BI. Attendees will gain hands-on experience in developing custom visuals, integrating them seamlessly with Power BI, and unlocking new insights from their data.

We will focus on the following key areas.

**Creating Interactive and Dynamic Visuals:**
Leveraging Python libraries, such as Matplotlib, Plotly, and Seaborn, to create captivating visuals. Enhancing interactivity with tooltips, drill-through, and filtering. Incorporating animations and dynamic updates to engage viewers.

**Advanced Techniques in Python Custom Visuals:**
Customizing visuals with themes, color palettes, and annotations. Incorporating interactive elements like sliders, dropdowns, and buttons. Integrating external data sources and APIs to enhance visualizations.

**Best Practices for Python Custom Visuals:**
Optimizing performance and responsiveness of custom visuals. Implementing accessibility features for inclusive visualization experiences. Testing, debugging, and troubleshooting Python custom visuals.
